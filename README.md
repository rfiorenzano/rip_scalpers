This will be a project to begin learning about web scraping and using more advanced concepts in Python. The ultimate result will be a script that will run to search for products online and commit to a purchase.

The project was spurred from a conversation with a fellow redditor (SociopathWithBipolar).

Their advice from our chat involved these parts:

// I recommend learning selenium, it’s fairly easy to use. So basically I wrote a script that searched multiple webpages, Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and I am pretty sure I had one or two more on their but I cannot recall what they where. Then I told the script to buy 1 if it wasn’t out of stock, and if it did buy one it changed a Boolean variable to tell itself to no longer continue if ps5_secured == True.

// What people refer to these scripts as is sniping bot

// From selenium you’d import webdriver, and chrome options. You’d then need to locate all the places you need to enter information throughout the webpages, login info, payment info, etc. Oh I almost forgot you’ll need to create a function to click buttons, which is easy to learn to do. The a function to enter the data. So once you locate the html elements location, you store them as variables, then you add some variables to declare the data you need to enter into those fields,  you then add the browser options you want then set up the driver then throw your functions into a while True loop or however you may want to set it up


This will be the foundational basis for this project, but ultimately I would love to strive to have this be a web app which others can use to get the things they are looking to buy online too. This at the moment is a pipe dream for sure since I do not have the skills to even make the script for myself yet (Date: 2020/12/08) but I hope to eventually get these as I practice.
